# Project Title

# Lightweight Deep Learning Model for Mobile Deployment of Animal Skin Lesion Classification

# Overview

# This project investigates model optimisation techniques for lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to animal skin lesion classification.
# The study explores Pruning, Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) to reduce model size and improve deployment feasibility while preserving accuracy.
